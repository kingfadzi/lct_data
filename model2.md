> **Note:**
> - **Dotted lines** in the diagram represent **implied relationships** â€” connections that are **not explicitly encoded** or enforced in the data model but are **logically inferred** (e.g., by source system config, structure, or operational behavior).
> - **Open Question:** Should these implied relationships be **formally encoded and tracked** in the data model?
